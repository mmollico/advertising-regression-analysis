# Advertising Regression Analysis
A basic univariate and multiple regression analysis on the classic advertising dataset.

#### Project Status: [Completed]

### Methods:
* Univariate Regression
* Multiple Regression
* Correlation

### Technologies:
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter, seaborn
* scikit-learn

## Description

As my past data science model building experience was entirely in R, the objective of this project was to familiarize myself with scikit-learn and data science in Python. I used the very well known "advertising" dataset which is a simple set of advertising spends of various types and the resulting sales. The features and target predicted variable are all continuous and the datset is complete and ready to model.

I performed some basic plotting eda, developed some functions to generate heatmaps with seaborn and some functions to run both univariate and multiple regression where I output some model evaluation parameters and plot the resulting line of best fit in the case of univariate regression.

### Inputs:
* advertising.csv
